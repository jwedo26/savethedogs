        <h1>About Save the Dogs</h1>
        <p>Our mission is to make sure every dog is saved from the tar pits. We provide free health and dental care to all rescued dogs, fully funded by public donations.</p>
        <p>We have a network of 50 foster homes and a 98% re-homing rate. Since January 2025, we have rescued over 300 dogs. 92 cents of every dollar goes directly to rescue operations.</p>
        <p>We have had support from celebrities like John Wick and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. Save the Dogs was founded by Chance Mead and co-founded by Jordan Wedo.</p>
